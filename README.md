# Hetzner Cloud - Kubernetes Cluster
This is a reference for deploying a kubernetes cluster on Hetzner Cloud.
It is based on the [Kube-Hetzner](https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner) project.
You can find some flavors of the deployment, from the simplest to the most extensive. And from the cheapest to the most reliable.

## Peanuts Cluster
This is the simplest and cheapest cluster you can deploy. It is composed of a single node, with 2 vCPUs, 4GB of RAM, and 40GB of disk space. It is not recommended for production environments, but it is a good starting point for learning and testing.
